        <h1>Markup languages</h1>

            <p class="text_normal">A <strong>markup language</strong> is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. Markup languages are used to annotate a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and can assign semantic meaning to the text.</p>

        <h2>Types of markup languages</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Presentational markup - used by traditional word-processing systems, implemented as binary codes embedded within document text (e.g. Microsoft Word)</li>
                <li>Procedural markup - markup is embedded in text, which then provides instructions for programs to process the text (e.g. TeX)</li>
                <li>Descriptive (logical) markup - markup is used to label parts of the document rather than to provide specific instructions as to how they should be processed (e.g. HTML)</li>
            </ul>


        <h3>HTML</h3>

            <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.</p>

            <p>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of the content to make it appear or act a certain way.</p>

        <h4>How the browser displays HTML</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The browser parses the HTML to construct the DOM tree</li>
                <li>The DOM tree is used to construct a render tree</li>
                <li>A layout is generated from the render tree</li>
                <li>The render three is painted to the screen according to the generated layout</li>
            </ol>
